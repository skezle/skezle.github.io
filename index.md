![Sam Kessler](https://raw.github.com/skezle/skezle.github.io/master/_assets/me.png "me")

* I'm currently a first year PhD student in the **Machine Learning Research Group** and 
**Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance** at the **University of Oxford** under
 the supervision of [Steve Roberts](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sjrob/) and 
 [Stefan Zohren](http://www.oxford-man.ox.ac.uk/node/2430). 
* I'm interested in Bayesian Deep Learning, Bayesian Continual Learning and their
applications to finance. 
* I did my first degree in Physics at Imperial College London, then a masters in 
Statistics at ETH Zurich.

## News

* I'm presenting my work Indian Buffet Neural Networks for Continual Learning at the 
Bayesian Deep Learning workshop at Neurips 2019 in Vancouver. Link coming soon.
* I was selected to attend MLSS Moscow in September 2019.

## Working papers

* Our work on [Practical Bayesian Neural Networks via Adaptive
Subgradient Optimization Methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.03679.pdf) is available on 
the arXiv.
