* I'm currently a first year PhD student in the Machine Learning Research Group and 
Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance at the University of Oxford under the supervision of Steve Roberts
 and Stefan Zohren. 
* I'm interested in Bayesian Deep Learning, Bayesian Continual Learning and their
applications to finance in particular. 
* I did my first degree in Physics at Imperial College London, then a masters in 
Statistics at ETH Zurich.

## News

* I'm presenting my work Indian Buffet Neural Networks for Continual Learning at the 
Bayesian Deep Learning workshop at Neurips 2019 in Vancouver. Link coming soon.
* I was selected to attend MLSS Moscow in September 2019.

## Working papers

* Our work on [Practical Bayesian Neural Networks via Adaptive
Subgradient Optimization Methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.03679.pdf) is available on 
the arXiv.
