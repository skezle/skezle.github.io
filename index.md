![Sam Kessler](https://raw.github.com/skezle/skezle.github.io/master/_assets/me.png "me")

* I'm currently in my 3rd year of my PhD in the **Machine Learning Research Group** and 
**Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance** at the **University of Oxford** under
 the supervision of [Steve Roberts](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sjrob/) and 
 [Stefan Zohren](http://www.oxford-man.ox.ac.uk/node/2430). 
* I'm interested in Bayesian Continual Learning and their
applications to RL and finance. 
* I did my first degree in Physics at Imperial College London, then a masters in 
Statistics at ETH Zurich.

## News
* I will be reviewing for AISTATS 2022
* I will be giving a talk about my research at the AI group research seminar at Dept. of Computer Scicene at the University of Bath on 30/06/21.
* I'll be presenting my work [Hierarchical Indian Buffet Neural Networks for Bayesian Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02290) as a spotlight presentation at UAI 2021.
* I will be interning Huawei Cambridge and applying ideas in Continual Learning to Self-Supervised Automatic Speech Recognition.
* I will be giving a talk about my research at the 13th Oxford-Man Institute Machine Learning Workshop on 22nd April 2021.
* I'm sub-reviewing for Neurips 2020 and ACML 2020.
* I'm an external reviewer for IJCAI 2020.
* I was selected to attend MLSS Moscow in September 2019.
