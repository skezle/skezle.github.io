![Sam Kessler](https://raw.github.com/skezle/skezle.github.io/master/_assets/me.png "me")


* I am a final year PhD student in the **Machine Learning Research Group** and 
**Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance** at the **University of Oxford** under
 the supervision of [Steve Roberts](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sjrob/) and 
 [Stefan Zohren](http://www.oxford-man.ox.ac.uk/node/2430). 
* I'm interested in Bayesian Continual Learning and their
applications to RL and finance. 
* I did my first degree in Physics at Imperial College London, then a masters in 
Statistics at ETH Zurich.

## News

* I am currently interning with Amazon'a Alexa team in Cambridge thinking of ways to make incremental learning of their speech models more efficient.
* This summer I will be attending the OxML summer school.
* I recently had my paper on the pitfalls of weight-space Bayesian continual learning "On Sequentual Bayesian Inference for Continual Learning" accepted at [Entropy](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/25/6/884)!
* I will be interning in Autumn 22 at Meta Reality Labs in Redmond and working on few-shot learning problems.
* I will be reviewing for AAAI23 and AISTATS23.
* I will be presenting my work in \[[CRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02940)\] at the \[[ContinualAI](https://www.continualai.org/)\] seminar on 9 June, \[[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHTmXcETsyU)\]
* I am a reviewer for ALOE@ICLR2022.
* My work on \[[CRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02940)\] has been selected for an oral presentation at AAAI 2022!
* My paper with Prof. Jerome Hergueux has been accepted to ACM SIGCHI 2022 in New Orleans.
