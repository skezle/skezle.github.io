![Sam Kessler](https://raw.github.com/skezle/skezle.github.io/master/_assets/me.png "me")

* I'm currently a first year PhD student in the **Machine Learning Research Group** and 
**Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance** at the **University of Oxford** under
 the supervision of [Steve Roberts](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sjrob/) and 
 [Stefan Zohren](http://www.oxford-man.ox.ac.uk/node/2430). 
* I'm interested in Bayesian Deep Learning, Bayesian Continual Learning and their
applications to finance. 
* I did my first degree in Physics at Imperial College London, then a masters in 
Statistics at ETH Zurich.

## News
* I'm sub-reviewing for Neurips 2020 and ACML 2020.
* I'm presenting my work on [Practical Bayesian Neural Networks via Adaptive Optimization Methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.03679.pdf) at the Uncertainty and Robustness workshop and [UNCLEAR: A Straightforward Method for Continual Reinforcement Learning](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GMTWC0C6jMTwtqZxoyq6a-VDxkrDCIHm/view) at the Continual Learning workshop, both at ICML 2020.
* I'm an external reviewer for IJCAI 2020.
* I'm presenting my work [Indian Buffet Neural Networks for Continual Learning](http://bayesiandeeplearning.org/2019/papers/63.pdf) at the 
Bayesian Deep Learning workshop at Neurips 2019 in Vancouver.
* I was selected to attend MLSS Moscow in September 2019.

## Working papers

* My work on [Hierarchical Indian Buffet Neural Networks for Bayesian Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02290) is on arXiv.
* We show that how leaders emerge in open source software projects in *Follow the Leader: Technical and Inspirational Leadership in Open Source Software* with Dr. Jerome Hergueux, research done while at ETH Zurich.
