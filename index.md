![Sam Kessler](https://raw.github.com/skezle/skezle.github.io/master/_assets/me.png "me")


* I am a final year PhD student in the **Machine Learning Research Group** under
 the supervision of [Steve Roberts](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sjrob/) and 
 [Stefan Zohren](http://www.oxford-man.ox.ac.uk/node/2430). 
* I'm interested in retaining skills under distributions shifts using Bayesian sequential inference and continual learning more broadly. I'm particularly interested in Continual Reinforcement Learning and
applications to finance.
* I did my first degree in Physics at Imperial College London, then a masters in 
Statistics at ETH Zurich.

## News

* I am currently interning with Amazon'a Alexa team in Cambridge thinking of ways to make incremental learning of their speech models more efficient.
* I am reviewing for AAAI 23 and AISTATS 23.
* This summer I will be attending the OxML summer school.
* I recently had my paper on the pitfalls of weight-space Bayesian continual learning "On Sequentual Bayesian Inference for Continual Learning" accepted at [Entropy](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/25/6/884)!
