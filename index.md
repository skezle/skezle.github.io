I'm currently a master's candidate in Statistics at ETH ZÃ¼rich. Previously I worked in industry, in data science and tech consulting and before that I did my MSci in Physics at Imperial College London.

I'm interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. In particular, I'm excited about applications to medicine, using new sources of data from mobile data and gene sequencing data to extract clinically useful information, to make better diagnoses and propose treatment plans for patients.

## Projects

*Deep learning for ultrasound elastography.* Palpation of the breast or prostate are still standard screening techniques used by doctors for cancer. Elastography based ultrasound is a cheap way to image the tissue from its displacements. A simulator can currently produce displacement field images from a ground truth tumour. I am using deep learning techniques to map the displacement fields back to the ground truth. Eventually I will inject clinical data into generative model to train a discriminator to distinguish actual clinical tumours and not just simulated ones. The work is a semester project in the [Vision lab](http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/en/) at ETH Zurich. 

*Road extraction from aerial image using denoising autoencoders.* Deep learning techniques were used to segment roads from aerial images. The solution used convolutional neural networks and denoising autoencoders. The project was for the Computational Intelligence Lab course at ETH Zurich. Code and write up available [here](https://github.com/paramoecium/road-segmentation).

*Beyond sequence to sequence dialogue systems.* Deep learning implementation of a chatbot. The project was for the Natural Language Understanding course at ETH Zurich. A seq2seq model and extensions of it were implemented using a movie database. Code and write up available [here](https://github.com/skezle/ethz-nlu-seq2seq).
